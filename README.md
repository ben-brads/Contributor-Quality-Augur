# Group1-Final-Project

What we did for sprint 4:  On the augur repository, we collected data on pull requrest events, pull comitt events, and issue events which is what we outlined in our design document.  

To see the final product, it is in the bottom of the Contributor_Quality_Collector Jupyter Notebook, with comments in each cell explaining what they do.

What I'd like to have done if we had more time is do analysis on each contributor, and based on different metrics (are they actively contributing to all 3 of those metrics, have they been involved heavily with issues) give a score on contributor 'quality' or 'activity'.

I think we showed a lot of progress from sprint 3 which is the 'contributor_quality' notebook we submitted.
