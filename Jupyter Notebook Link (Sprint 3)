*********ACTIVELY WORKING ON THIS IF YOU LOOK AT IT RIGHT NOW

Right now I'm connected to the database provided and pulling all the contributor ID's.  For sprint 4 my idea is to query the github api with those id's 
and get the data specified in the other sprints, then present that data in a pandas dataframe.
